# Omnipay: Taluspay

**Taluspay driver for the Omnipay PHP payment processing library**

[Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay) is a framework agnostic, multi-gateway payment
processing library for PHP 5.3+. This package implements [PayTrace](https://www.paytrace.net) support for Omnipay.

An attempt to move this to omnipay 3 and PayTrace JSON api.
## Installation
(to be updated - probably I'll have to name fork differently to be able to use it instead of current omnipay-paytrace)


For general usage instructions, please see the main [Omnipay](https://github.com/thephpleague/omnipay)
repository.
